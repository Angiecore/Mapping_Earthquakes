# Mapping_Earthquakes
interactive maps using GeoJSON data, JS and APIs.

Earthquake data in relation to the tectonic plates' location on the earth. All the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map. For GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieved geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes. Used the JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data and the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request in order to create interactivity for the earthquake data.
